You’re an image pale that points and laughs
White mistress in a fiery bath
Now tie me down and take me home
I’m not afraid to go
Now tie me down and take me home
I’m not afraid to go

[Pre-chorus:]
Shake the roots off the trees
Your conscience fades
Eyes have no vision to see
Your soul degrades
Grey follows in front of me
You’ve lost your way
Every life is but a death to me

[Chorus:]
Eventually the jokes aren’t free and
Nothing’s ever fun and
Nothing’s funny

[Verse 2:]
Blunt self believe, too big to fall
Lead shadow stands just inches tall
I hope to God you never die
Your joke is just my type

[Pre-chorus:]
Shake the roots off the trees
Your conscience fades
Eyes have no vision to see
Your soul degrades
Grey follows in front of me
You’ve lost your way
Every life is but a death to me

[Chorus:]
Eventually the jokes aren’t free and
Nothing’s ever fun and
Nothing’s funny

But now I see that the joke’s on me and
Nothing’s ever fun and
Nothing’s funny

Don’t be scared
Don’t be scared
Don’t be scared
Don’t be scared
Don’t be scared

[Chorus:]
Eventually the jokes aren’t free and
Nothing's ever fun and
Nothing's funny

But now I see that the joke's on me and
Nothing's ever fun and
Nothing's funny

Your joke is just my type
